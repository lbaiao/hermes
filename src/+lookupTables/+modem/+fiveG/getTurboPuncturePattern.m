function [ puncturePattern ] = getTurboPuncturePattern( desiredCodeRate )
%getTurboPuncturePattern loads the puncture pattern for turbo encoders
%
%  The puncture patterns were built following the rules presented in:
%       3GPP 3GPP/TSG/RAN/WG1 meeting 4: TSGR1#4(99) 338
%       Title: Puncturing Algorithm for Turbo Code
%       Avilable in: 
%       ftp://www.3gpp.org/tsg_ran/WG1_RL1/TSGR1_04/Docs/Pdfs/R1-99338.PDF
%     
%  Syntax:    
%       [ puncturePattern ] = getTurboPuncturePattern( desiredCodeRate )
%
%  Inputs:
%      desiredCodeRate < double > - expected code rate after puncturing.
%
%  Output:
%      puncturePattern < KxM Double > - Contains the atomic part for the
%           puncture pattern. K is the number of input bits considered 
%           for the atomic part and M is the original number of encoder 
%           outputs, for Turbo Encoders, M=3. 
%           Example: For a 3/4 rate, K=6 and M = 3.
%           In the puncture vector, '1's represent the bits to be kept in
%           the message, while '0's represent bits to be punctured.
