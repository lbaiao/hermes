%SPATIALCODER.EQUALIZENONE method calls the non-MIMO equalizer scheme.
%   
%   Syntax: [ equalizedSignal ] = equalize( mimoSignal, ...
%                                               channel ) 
%   Input:
%       mimoSignal < Nsymb x NRx complex > - received signal.
%           Nsymb: number of symbols in the frame.
%           NRx: number of receive antennas.
%       channel < Nsymb x NRx x NTx complex > - channel gain at each data
%           symbol.
%           NTx: number of transmit antennas.
%   Output:
%       equalizedSignal < Nsymb x 1 complex > - decoded symbols.
%       	Nsymb : number of data symbols in the frame.
