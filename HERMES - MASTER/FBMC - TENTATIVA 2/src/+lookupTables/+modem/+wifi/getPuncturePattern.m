function [ puncturePattern ] = getPuncturePattern( desiredCodeRate )
%getPuncturePattern loads the lookup table for the encoder puncture pattern 
%
%  See STANDARD IEEE Std 802.11ac:
%     * Sub-clause 18, Figure 18-9: Example of the bit-stealing and bit
%     and bit-insertion procedure (r = 3/4, 2/3).
%     * Sub-clause 20, Figure 20-11: Puncturing at rate 5/6.
%
%  Syntax:    
%       [ puncturePattern ] = getPuncturePattern( desiredCodeRate )
%
%  Inputs:
%      desiredCodeRate < double > - expected code rate after puncturing.
%
%  Output:
%      puncturePattern < KxM Double > - Contains the atomic part for the
%           puncture pattern. K is the number of input bits and M is
%           the original number of encoder outputs, for WiFi, M=2. 
%           Example: For a 3/4 rate, K=3 and M = 2.
%           In the puncture vector, '1's represent the bits to be kept in
%           the message, while '0's represent bits to be punctured.
