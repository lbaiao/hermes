function setPunctureVector( this, arraySize ) 
%EncoderRateMatching.setPunctureVector sets puncturing vector.
%This function adapts the puncturing vector for the real size of the
%encoded packet.
%
% Syntax: puncturedArray =  setPunctureVector ( this, arraySize ) 
% Inputs: arraySize < int >: Number of bits in the encoded array size.

% Seed: Atomic Part of the puncture pattern in column-array form:
punctureVectorSeed = reshape( this.puncturePattern, [], 1 );
% Number of times the Atomic part of the puncture should be repeated:
punctureSamples = floor( arraySize / length( punctureVectorSeed ) );
% Create the puncture vector with the size needed:
this.punctureVector = repmat( punctureVectorSeed, punctureSamples , 1);

% Check if it is necessary repeat a part of the puncture pattern due to
% a mismatch in the array size:
tail = mod( arraySize , length( punctureVectorSeed ) );
if tail ~= 0
    % Add the tail if needed:
    this.punctureVector = [ this.punctureVector; punctureVectorSeed( 1: tail) ];
end
% Convert the puncture vector from double to logic:
this.punctureVector  = this.punctureVector > 0;
end
