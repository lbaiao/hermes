%INNERRECEIVER.EQUALIZE Signal equalization in the frequency domain.
%   This is a protected method of InnerReceiver that performs signal 
%   equalization in the frequency domain, according to the equalization 
%   type set at the constructor.
%
%   Syntax: [ signalOut,
%             coefficients ] = equalize ( signalIn, channel,noiseVariance )
%
%   Please note that MMSE equalizer considers that transmitted symbol has unit
%   energy.
% 
%   Input:
%       signalIn < Nsubc x Nsymb complex x NRx > - received symbol, where
%           NRx is the number of receive antennas, Nsubc is the number of
%           subcarriers and Nsymb the number of symbols in the frame.
%       channel < Nsubc x Nsymb x NRx x NTx complex > - the channel
%           gain at each symbol and subcarrier, with NTx the number of
%           transmit antennas, Nsymb the number of symbols in a frame and
%           Nsubc the number of non-zero subcarriers.
%       noiseVarianceOut< double > - estimated noise variance
%   Output:
%       signalOut < Nsubc x Nsymb x Nstr complex> - received symbol, where
%           Nstr is the number of spatial streams, Nsubc is the number of
%           subcarriers and Nsymb the number of symbols in the frame.
%       coefficients< Nsubc x Nsymb x Nstr double > - equalizer coefficients
