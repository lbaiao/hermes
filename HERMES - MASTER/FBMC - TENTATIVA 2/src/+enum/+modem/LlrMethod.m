%   Read-Only Public Properties
%      IDEAL_AWGN - calculates the true LLR for an AWGN channel
%                   (considering all constellation points)
%      NEAREST_AWGN - calculate LLR based on the nearest constellation
%                     points only for an AWGN channel
%      LINEAR_APPROXIMATION - calculate LLR based on a piece-wise linear 
%                             aproximation for a known constellation
