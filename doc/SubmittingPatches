        How to Get Your Change Into BARE


This document provides basic instructions for patch submission, and
useful tricks to work with gerrit and git.

Based on Linux Kernel documentation[1].

-----------------------------------
SECTION 1 - Environment Setup
-----------------------------------
1) First-Time Git Setup

Recommended git client: http://git-scm.com/download/win

Signature is mandatory for all commits. Use your INdT address to sign
your patches.
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@indt.org.br

Checking your settings
$ git config --list

2) Cloning hermes repository
Requirements: SSH public key uploaded to gerrit (http://gerrit.indt.org),
and user added to bare-devel group (contact the administrators:
loide.jesus@indt.org.br or claudio.takahasi@indt.org.br).
$git clone ssh://johndoe@gerrit.indt.org:29418/hermes hermes.git

3) Change-Id - Mandatory
Gerrit tracks patchset versions based on "Change-Id" hash included in
the commit message. When amending or picking commits, commit-msg hook
keeps the "Change-Id" or includes a new hash in order to allow the
Gerrit server to track revisions. This procedure is similar to
"--in-reply-to" option.

Copying "commit-msg" script:
$scp -p -P 29418 johndoe@gerrit.indt.org:/hooks/commit-msg .
$mv commit-msg .git/hooks

Optional step, testing "Change-Id":
$git commit -a -s --allow-empty (Adds a new Change-Id at the end of message)
$git log -p
$git commit --amend -s (keeps the current Change-Id")
$git log -p
$git reset --hard HEAD~1

4) git review tool - Optional

http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/git-review

Gerrit WEB frontend can be used for review, and manage reviewers list.
For advanced users/developers, git-review command-line can be used to
automate some tasks.

step 1: Adding gerrit remote
$git remote add gerrit ssh://johndoe@gerrit.indt.org:29418/hermes

step 2: Configuring the reviewers to be automatically added when
submiting changes:

Ignore this step if you want to manage manually the reviewers using
gerrit web services.

$git config remote.gerrit.receivepack 'git receive-pack --reviewer \
richard.roe@indt.org.br --reviewer jane.doe@indt.org.br'
$ git review --setup

---------------------------------------
SECTION 2 - Gerrit & git workflow
---------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|      LOCAL Repository           |        Git/Gerrit server                            |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hermes.git          <-- clone(1) -- |        hermes.git
devel_johndoe(2)                  |
devel_johndoe      -- push(3) --> | refs/for/master(4) -- review(5) --> rework (6)
devel_johndoe(7)   -- push(8) --> | refs/for/master(9) -- review(10) --> remote/master(11)

(1)  See SECTION 1.2
(2)  It is strongly recomended to implement your features using
     development branches instead of local master. Use the following
     command to create a new branch (using master as baseline):
     $ git checkout -b devel_johndoe
     Instructions to create a NEW commit are described in the
     SECTION 3.3.
(3)  Submits your patches for review (see SECTION 3.5). Pushing your
     patches will create changes on gerrit for review/integration.
     "Change-Id" mentioned earlier is the 'key' used to manage changes,
     and versioning.
(4)  The author will receive an e-mail and must select the reviewers
     (Gerrit WEB) when "gerrit review tool" is not properly configured.
(5)  The author receives an email when the reviewer publish his
     comments.
(6)  Use commit "amend" option to commit your rework. Amend appends
     the changes in your last commit. Note that git hash changes, and
     Change-Id hash remains the same. Allowing gerrit to trace a new
     version of a given change/patch.
(7)  Rebase (IMPORTANT) your changes before pushing your re-work for
     review. Other patches (from other developers) may be integrated
     during your re-work.
(8)  Same as (3)
(9)  A new version is created in the gerrit change control, and the
     reviewers will receive automatically an e-mail.
(10) Change/patch will be automatically integrated in the repository
     after the reviewers approves it.

Git[3] is a distributed version control system, nearly every operation
is LOCAL. Gerrit[2] is a free, web-based collaborative code review tool
that INTEGRATES with Git creating an abstraction for managing review
patches (a.k.a. changes in Gerrit) and automatically merge patches to
master.

"Change-Id" is the key to control threads/versions. Abandoned patchsets
may return "no changes". If you need to re-create a new thread/patchset
remove the "Change-Id": commit-msg hook will add automatically a new
hash value.

Commit message example containing Change-Id:

"commit b2b0ac3364d3ee81ef448e3b2c2adbcc49a27b9f
Author: John Doe <john.doe@indt.org.br>
Date:   Wed Nov 12 09:42:43 2014 -0400

    Initial empty repository

    Change-Id: Iedf416535bf2dc058f9f80c2a6d90d9bbedc4435
    Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@indt.org.br>
"

Git SHA1 hash represents the state of the repository at certain point.
Change-Id is *restricted* to Gerrit, it is global unique hash added
automatically in the footer of a commit message by the git commit-msg
hook. When present, Gerrit uses this hash to track commits across
cherry-picks, rebases, and review versions.

AVOID using git merge command, rebase command will provide a similar
result beyond keeping your workflow easier. Rebase forces developers to
solve conflicts locally with other patches, and ignore old patch
versions.

--------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 - CREATING AND SENDING YOUR CHANGE
--------------------------------------------

1) Describe your changes.

Describe your problem.  Whether your patch is a one-line bug fix or
5000 lines of a new feature, there must be an underlying problem that
motivated you to do this work.  Convince the reviewer that there is a
problem worth fixing and that it makes sense for them to read past the
first paragraph.

Avoid phrasal verbs in gerund form, describe your changes in imperative
mood, e.g. "make xyzzy do frotz" instead of "[This patch] makes xyzzy
do frotz" or "[I] changing xyzzy to do frotz", as if you are giving
orders to the codebase to change its behaviour.

2) Development branches

Before creating a new branch always fetch the latest commits and
rebase your local master branch. For maintainance purpose, it is
encouraged to follow a standard for branch names.

$git checkout -b devel_<johndoe>_<featurename>

3) Git Commits

After switching to your development branch you are ready to start the
development of a new feature (or bug fixing). Use a incremental
approach breaking your development in small chunks/blocks of functional
code. If you are not familiar with git commands, please avoid using
"-a" option to add all the changed (only versioned) files when
commiting.

* How to add a file (new or versioned) to a NEW commit:
$git add file.m
$git commit -s

Note that Change-Id and Signed-of-by are added automatically at the
bottom of the commit message body.

* How amend (append) changes to an EXISTING (last) commit:
$git add file.m
$git commit --amend

Note that git commit hash is changed, and Change-Id hash remains the
same.

4) Submitting DRAFTS to master

Gerrit allows pushing draft patches. It can be used as backup or to
share earlier patch versions. Later, reviewers or admins can promote
the patchset to merge candidate. For shared feature development,
development branches (See SECTION 4) is another alternative to temporarily
share patches and rebase them easly in your local development branch.

$git push origin HEAD:refs/drafts/master

Visit the gerrit commit url to manage/select the reviewers.

5) Submitting patch to master

In order to avoid potential conflicts, rebase your development branch
before submitting your patches:
$git fetch remote
$git rebase origin/master

Submitting your COMMITS to remote for review/integration:
$git push gerrit HEAD:refs/for/master

For tortoise-git users, set origin as HEAD (or your development branch)
and remote as "refs/for/master".

"refs/for/master" means "Please submit this as a review for branch
master".

This command creates traceable patchsets manageable through the gerrit
server web server.

Replacing "gerrit" by "origin" (when pushing changes) has a similar
effect. Except the fact that "origin" doesn't have reviewer list enabled.

----------------------------------------
SECTION 4 - Remote Development branches
----------------------------------------

Directly push to (origin) master is strictly forbidden. Gerrit access control
rules are enabled preventing push attempts of branches outside the developers
namespace, refs/for/drafts, or refs/for/master.

Development branches usage is RESTRICTED to backup or temporarily SHARING the
code with other users. It SHOULD NOT be used to develop experimental features.
Configuration options can be used to enable/disable features, ALL developed
code should be properly integrated and tagged.

For each user, a personal namespace is available following the defined
standard:
refs/heads/sandbox/${username}/*

Pushing Alicia's branch to gerrit/git server (--force is allowed):
$git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/sandbox/alicia/devel_alicia

Fetching the changes from another machine (eg: John's repo):
$git remote update

The previous git command fetches the objects references (commits/branches/tags)
from the gerrit/git server. If you need to create an integration branch (shared
development), rebase your development branch after fetching the remote branch.
git-rebase command will forward/shift your local commits to the head (top of
your branch).
eg:
local master:
  commit hash: bbbb...
  commit hash: aaaa...

remote/devel_alicia:
  commit hash: cccc...
  commit hash: bbbb...
  commit hash: aaaa...

devel_johndoe (current branch, using local master as baseline):
  commit hash: eeee... (new commit: feature 2)
  commit hash: ffff... (new commit: feature 1)
                      <<< Rebase inserts 'cccc...' here
  commit hash: bbbb...
  commit hash: aaaa...

$git rebase -i origin/sandbox/alicia/devel_alicia
(Assuming devel_johndoe as current branch)

Deleting remote branches (Access restricted to the owner)
$git push :refs/heads/sandbox/johndoe/devel_johndoe
(John's repo/machine)

$git push :refs/heads/sandbox/alicia/devel_alicia
(Alicia's repo/machine)
