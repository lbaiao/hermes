SECTION 1 - Version Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Heterogeneous Radio Mobile Simulator, Hermes, is a semi-static time-driven 
link level simulator. This is an object-oriented simulator, 
developed in Matlab version 2014b.




The main features of this version of the simulator are:


The current version of the code is organized as follows:

hermes folder
	Contains files that are needed for lauching the simulator.
	The main files are:
	- executeTests - used to automatically run unit tests
	- hermes - calls hermesStart() function
	- hermesMain - 	the magic happens here! :) This is the main simulation
		       	file, where the scenario is created and where the simulation
			loop is started.
	
	Brief explanation of hermes folders:
	>> doc contains the simulator documentation
	>> parameters contains parameters files
	>> src contains the code source. 
		+ channel: channel specific classes and methods
		+ enum: enumerated constants classes
		+ lookupTables: tables gathered from technology specs.
		+ modem: all classes related to transmission or reception of signals
		+ networkEntity: classes related to the node or antennas
		+ parameterCheck: classes & methods related to checking the parameters
		+ scenario: contemplates the scenario creationg according to paramenters.
		+ simulatorCore: classes to manage the simulation loop & statistics
		+ source: generation / comparison of bits		

	>> unit contains the unit tests for all defined classes and 
           functions

SECTION 2 - Getting access to the code
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This version of the simulator is available to INDT employees.

Hermes code is available at: 
git clone http://<user-name>@gerrit.indt.org/hermes

To have access to this code, please contact:

SECTION 3 - Using the simulator
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Setting the parameters


The parameters are read from input folder "parameters"

In this version, two files are available as examples of input parameters:
	+ generalSimulationSettings
	+ lteSimulationSettings / fivegSimulationSettings (depending on the desired technology)

a) generalSimulationSettings sets parameters related to the 
simulation loop and the simulation scenario. 

Examples of the parameters set in this file:
- Number of simulation drops
- SNR vector
- Simulation duration
- Number and configuration of simulation nodes
- Number and configuration of simulation modems

Important definitions:
NODE: it is a spatial indexation of modems
MODEM: reception or transmission modem. One node may be associated with
many modems.

b) lteSimulationSettings/ fiveGSimulationSettings are a technology-specific
   simulation files.

Examples of the parameters set in this file:
- Duplex Mode
- System bandwidth
- Subcarrier spacing


c) Including new RATs in the simulation

The RAT of a modem is defined in the generalSimulationSettings, by the
parameter

			SETTINGS.SCENARIO.MODEM{ x }.TECHNOLOGY

x corresponds to the modem index in this simulation.

Possible values for this parameter are available at:
src/+enum/Technology

Once the technology is set, the simulator will load the parameters defined 
in the technology specific parameter file, described in Section 3b


2) Starting a simulation

Before running the first simulation, all the mex-files must be compiled, by
calling
>> compileHermes

It is necessary that a Matlab-supported C++ compiler be installed.


There are several forms of starting a local simulation:
    + With predefined input file, results folder name and seed
    + With predefined input file and results folder name. Random seed.
	+ With predefined input file, default results folder name and random 
      seed.
    + With default input file and results folder name. Random seed.
	
a) Predefined input file, results folder name and seed

To start a simulation using predefined seed and folders name, use
the function:

>> hermesStart( inputParametersDir, resultsDirectory, seed )

In this case, parameters will be read from inputParametersDir,
results will be saved in resultsDirectory,
and the simulation will use the seed specified.
If the folder parameters may be left empty [], then the default folders
will be considered

b) Predefined input file and results folder name. Random seed.

>> hermesStart( inputParametersDir, resultsDirectory )

In this case, parameters will be read from inputParametersDir,
results will be saved in resultsDirectory. A random seed will be generated.

c) Predefined input file, default results folder name and random seed.

>> hermesStart( inputParametersDir )

d) With default input file and results folder name. Random seed.
>> hermes

In this case, parameters will be read from inputParametersDir. Results will
be saved in a new directory called:

results/Year-Month-Day_Hour-Minute-Second

A random seed will be used.


This function calls script hermesStart( ), in this case,
inputParametersDir is replaced by "parameters" dir, a random seed
is used for the simulation and a new directory is created with the name:

	results/Year-Month-Day_Hour-Minute-Second

3) Reading the results

The results are always saved in the resultsDirectory, as well as the
parameters file.
Results are aggregated in a .mat file that contains the struct statistics.
The fields of this struct are:

+ snrVector < 1 x SNRvalues double >: Vector with SNR values used in the
simulation
+ confidenceLevel < double >: Desired confidence level of the bit error 
rate at the end of the simulation
+ berMean < 1 x SNR values double >: Mean value of BER, per SNR level
+ blerMean < 1 x SNR values double >: Mean value of BLER, per SNR level
+ berErrorMargin  < 1 x SNR values double >: error margin of BER, per 
SNR level
+ blerErrorMargin < 1 x SNR values double >: error margin of BLER, per 
SNR level
